My Bitbar Plugins

### clipboard.5s.sh
Inspired by [Clipy](https://github.com/Clipy/Clipy) and [clipboard-history](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar-plugins/blob/master/System/clipboard-history.3s.sh).

This plugin track clipboard history up to 50 and group every 10 items just like Clipy does.

If you have some text that will be used frequently, you can store it in snippet. Snippet will keep exist until manually delete.

### vocabulary-words.1h
Because I am easy to forget (or too lazy) to open my vocabulary word book. So there it is.

By default, it randomly choose 10 words every 24 hours from ~/.Bitbar/vocabulary-words/dictionary. 

The format of dictionary is

1th word - any description

2th word - any description

...

e.g. my dictionary:

abbreviate - v. 縮短、縮寫

aberrant - a. 越軌、異常的
